# Roadmap

## 1.0 Must haves

- Support for non-ROS environments
  - Fido currently assumes ROS to be the de facto environment
  - Better Abstraction of environments, currently Fido uses Protocol for distinguishing environments
- Clarify simulation versus real-life robot control
- Support addition and removal of robot during simulation time
  - Implement as simulator functionality

## Planned features

- Support for multiple concurrent simulations
- Server side Fido
- Better logging or structured logging
- Automatically generate Fido DTypes from ROS messages (similar to `genpy`)

## Other QoL improvements

- Custom catkin workspace
  - Currently all catkin workspace is created at runtime, we want 1) reusing existing workspaces, and 2) using user-provided workspace.
- CUDA support in base image
- Custom Gazebo GUI for `Gazebo.view()`
